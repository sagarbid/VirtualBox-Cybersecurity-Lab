# VirtualBox-Cybersecurity-Lab
A hands-on virtual lab environment built with VirtualBox featuring Windows, Ubuntu, and Kali Linux VMs. Designed for cybersecurity training, network testing, and ethical hacking practice.
Overview
This lab simulates a small enterprise network with isolated VMs for safe experimentation. Key goals:

Practice network configuration and segmentation.

Run reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and basic exploitation.

Test incident response workflows.

Demonstrate skills relevant to SOC Analyst roles (e.g., log analysis, host hardening).

VM Roles:

Kali Linux: Attacker machine for pentesting tools (Nmap, Metasploit).

Ubuntu: Vulnerable target (web server, SSH).

Windows: Client workstation (simulates endpoint with basic services).
